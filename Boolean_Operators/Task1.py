#Boolean Operators
#Boolean values (True, False)
# [ ] Use relational and/or arithmetic operators with the variables x and y to write:
# 3 expressions that evaluate to True (i.e. x >= y)
# 3 expressions that evaluate to False (i.e. x <= y)

x = 84
y = 17



print(x >= y)
print(x >= y and x >= y)
print(x >= y or x >= y)


print(x <= y)
print(x <= y and x <= y)
print(x <= y or x <= y)


#Boolean operators (not, and, or)
# [ ] Use the basic Boolean operators with the variables x and y to write:
# 3 expressions that evaluate to True (i.e. not y)
# 3 expressions that evaluate to False (i.e. x and y)

x = True
y = False


print( x and not y )
print( x or not y )
print( y or not  y )

print( not x and y)
print( not x and x and y )
print( not y and x and y )
