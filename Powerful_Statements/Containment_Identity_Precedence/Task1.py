#List containment
# [ ] The `records` list contains information about a company's employees
# each of the elements in `records` is a list containing the name and ID of an employee.
# Write a program to test if `applicant` is contained in `records` and display an appropriate message

# Records of names and IDs
records = [['Colette', 22347], ['Skye', 35803], ['Alton', 45825], ['Jin', 24213]]
applicant = ['Joana', 20294]
if (applicant in records):
   print("ok")
else:
   print("Bull Shit")


#String containment
# [ ] Write a program to prompt the user for a letter (capital or small) then print if the number is a vowel
# HINT: Use a string containing all the vowels and the `in` or `not in` operator
